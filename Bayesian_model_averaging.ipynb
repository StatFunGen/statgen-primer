    "BMA accounts for the uncertainty involved in selecting the model, **preserving the uncertainty about models**.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Improved Accuracy**: If models make different types of errors, combining their predictions can reduce the variance and bias, leading to more accurate predictions\n",
