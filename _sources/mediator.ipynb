    "## What is Mediation?\n",
    "\n",
    "A mediator is a variable that **explains the mechanism** by which a genetic variant affects an outcome. Unlike confounders (which create bias) or colliders (which induce bias when controlled), mediators represent the **actual biological pathway**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mediation vs Other Variable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "When deciding whether to control for a variable, ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mediator**: \"Does this variable explain HOW the SNP affects the outcome?\"\n",
    "- **Action**: Can control to isolate effects not through the mediator\n",
    "- **Structure**: SNP -> Mediator -> Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confounder**: \"Does this variable affect both SNP and outcome?\"  \n",
    "- **Action**: Must control to remove bias\n",
    "- **Structure**: SNP <- Confounder -> Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collider**: \"Is this variable caused by both SNP and outcome?\"\n",
    "- **Action**: Never control - creates bias\n",
    "- **Structure**: SNP -> Collider <- Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mediation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Total Effect} = \\text{Effect through Mediator} + \\text{Other Effects}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **Total Effect**: SNP -> Outcome ($\\beta$ without controlling for mediator)\n",
    "- **Effect through Mediator**: SNP -> Mediator -> Outcome (the mediated pathway = $a \\times b$)\n",
    "- **Other Effects**: Effect NOT through the mediator ($\\beta$ when controlling for mediator - includes unmeasured pleiotropy)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evidence for Mediation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strong evidence** when controlling for the mediator:\n",
    "1. **Reduces effect size**: Total effect > Effect after controlling for mediator\n",
    "2. **Eliminates significance**: p-value increases substantially\n",
    "3. **Biological plausibility**: Mediator is in known pathway\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Estimate total effect**: `lm(Outcome ~ SNP)` (should be significant)\n",
    "2. **Test for mediation**: `lm(Outcome ~ SNP + Mediator)` (SNP effect should reduce/disappear)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "- If SNP effect disappears -> **Complete mediation**\n",
    "- If SNP effect reduces -> **Partial mediation**  \n",
    "- If SNP effect unchanged -> **No mediation**\n",

    "**Examples of Mediation**:\n",

    "- SNP -> Protein Levels -> Metabolic Trait\n",
    "- SNP -> Hormone Levels -> Growth/Development\n",

However, when we control for growth hormone as a mediator, the pattern dramatically changes: Variant 3's association completely disappears (p-value increases from 0.007 to 0.337), indicating that its effect on height is entirely through the growth hormone pathway rather than through other mechanisms.\n",
